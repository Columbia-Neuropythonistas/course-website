Here are some Python resources that we have found to be particularly helpful

## Python Courses

* [Berkeley Python Course (2018)](https://github.com/profjsb/python-seminar/tree/master/DataFiles_and_Notebooks)
* [Columbia Applied Machine Learning Course (2019)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s19/schedule/)
  * The first few lectures give a nice introduction to git version control, plotting, and the sklearn library
