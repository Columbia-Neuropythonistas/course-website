Here are some Python resources that we have found to be particularly helpful

## Python Textbooks
* [Python Data Science Handbook (Jake VanderPlas 2016)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.06-linear-regression.html) - available on git hub with accompanying notebooks. Very readable!

## Python Courses

* [Berkeley Python Course (2018)](https://github.com/profjsb/python-seminar/tree/master/DataFiles_and_Notebooks)
  * This comprehensive, semester-long course by Prof. Joshua Bloom is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in learning more about Python and data analysis. The lectures/notebooks here are detailed and well explained.
* [Columbia Applied Machine Learning Course (2019)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s19/schedule/)
  * The first few lectures by Andreas Muller give a nice introduction to git version control, plotting, and the sklearn library

## Git Resources

* The Zuckerman Institute github repository has a great introductory git tutorial here: [Version Control with Git](https://zuckermanbrain.github.io/git-novice/). We highly recommend working through this tutorial (~0.5-1 hour)
* Here is a short, visual introduction to git version control [A Grip On Git](https://agripongit.vincenttunru.com/)
* This is a more intricate but helpful git reference: [A Visual Git Reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)

## Libraries/Packages
* [`numpy`](#) - for nunmerical matrix/array operations
* [`matplotlib`](#) - for plotting
* [`pandas`](#) - for handling data in table-like structures ("DataFrames")

* [`scipy`](#) - for scientific and engineering functions
* [`seaborn`](#) - nice formatting for plotting with pandas DataFrames

* [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/) - a rich statistical package similar to R
* [`sklearn`](#)



## Miscellaneous
* [The meaning of underscores in Python](https://dbader.org/blog/meaning-of-underscores-in-python) (referenced in lecture 4)
